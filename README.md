meld
====

Node.js implementation of a mind meld game.

Description
-----------
Mind meld is a game in which players say words at the same time each round and try to eventually 
say the same word, by guessing what word might be in the 'middle' of the last two words. You're
not allowed to reuse a word you or your partner have used.

Setup
-----
This project exists as a node.js server that runs the game logic and serves the static pages, and
the web pages that run the UI logic and talk back to the server.
